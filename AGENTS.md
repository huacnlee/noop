## Workflow for Small Fixes

For small fixes with clear scope and acceptance criteria, make the change directly and verify it. Do not create design documents, specs, implementation plans, or extra approval checkpoints. Use a full design and planning workflow only when the change affects architecture or public APIs, spans multiple subsystems, or has materially ambiguous requirements.

## Update Noop on the user's iPhone

When asked to update Noop on the user's iPhone, build the current working-tree app, install it over Wi-Fi, and verify that it launches. The paired iPhone is `00008150-001603543C08401C`; the app bundle ID is `dev.noop.app`. Use `xcrun devicectl list devices` and device details to check connectivity.

The existing device build is `app/.nsh/out/noop.app`. Its embedded provisioning profile and signing authority identify the correct signing configuration: inspect the app with `codesign -dvv` and match its `Authority` to an identity from `security find-identity -v -p codesigning`. Do not assume the first certificate in the provisioning profile is the right identity. On 2026-11-02 the working identity was `Apple Development: Huashun Li (MJMFDP85B6)`, fingerprint `23A880371F9BA289EA15125ED6473F4C73F90BD6`.

Prefer `nsh package app --target ios --sign <identity> --profile <profile>` when the iOS runtime can be built. Copy the embedded profile to a temporary location first so it survives replacement of the output app. If the runtime build is blocked, the following workflow was verified with the existing runtime: `nsh build app --release -o <temporary-bundle>`, copy the existing app to a temporary `.app`, replace its `nsh/bundle.nshc`, `nsh/app.json`, and `nsh/capabilities.json` with the freshly built files, then sign the copy using the existing `app/.nsh/out/noop.entitlements`. This fallback reuses the existing native runtime; if native runtime changes are needed, build a fresh package instead.

Verify the signature with `codesign --verify --strict`, install with `xcrun devicectl device install app --device 00008150-001603543C08401C <app-path>`, then launch with `xcrun devicectl device process launch --device 00008150-001603543C08401C dev.noop.app`. Preserve the bundle ID so the installation updates the existing app and retains its data. Report any build, signing, connection, or launch failure accurately.
