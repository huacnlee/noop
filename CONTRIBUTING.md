# Contributing to noop

Technical reference for people and AI agents working on this codebase.

## Principles

- Single owner. noop serves one person (the CEO); there is no multi-tenant or shared service. Each user deploys their own Cloudflare Worker.
- No personal data or secrets in this repository. Templates are generic.
- Everything is Bun + TypeScript. The client is written with NSH.
- The owner only sees results and decisions. Never surface raw errors, internal routine failures or test data.

## Docs

- [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) — how noop works: sync, Worker API, code layout, agents and safety.

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun test                 # unit + sync tests
bash test/e2e.sh         # offline end to end (fake CLI, HUB_SYNC_FAKE store)
bunx tsc --noEmit
```

Worker:

```bash
cd cloud && bunx wrangler dev --port 8799 --var HUB_TOKEN:test
bun cloud/test/run.ts http://127.0.0.1:8799      # file sync harness (see cloud/test)
```

App: `cd app && ~/work/nsh/target/debug/nsh test` and `./build-web.sh`.

## Releasing the client apps

Push a tag `vX.Y.Z`. [release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml) packages Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS and Android and publishes them as a GitHub release; pull requests that change the workflow or the installers build them without publishing. The tag sets the app version and the run number sets the build number.

The workflow builds nsh from the commit in `NSH_REF` and caches it; a commit not yet cached takes a while on each runner. Android signing uses the secrets `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` and `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`. Keep that key: Android refuses an update signed with another one. The iOS package is unsigned.

Do not run tests against a production Worker or a live `DATA` directory.
