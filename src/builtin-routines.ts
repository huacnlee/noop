1. Run \`noop security\` and include its output as is (Worker: 2FA, sessions, OAuth clients, owner allow-list, mail, IP allow-list; this machine's Noop files and listening address).
2. Check this computer with read-only commands that fit its OS (skip what doesn't apply, never use sudo or anything that prompts):
   - OS and package updates pending (security ones first); last reboot if a kernel update is waiting
   - firewall on; listening sockets reachable beyond localhost (ss -ltnp / lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN) and what owns them
   - SSH server: running? PasswordAuthentication / PermitRootLogin; ~/.ssh keys and authorized_keys permissions
   - disk encryption (FileVault / LUKS), screen lock / auto-login
   - recent logins (last / log show) from unexpected places; new launch agents, systemd user units or cron jobs
   - secrets readable by others: ~/.noop, ~/.claude, ~/.codex, ~/.config/gh, ~/.aws, .env files in ~/work (permissions only, never print contents)
3. Write the full report to reports/security/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<host>.md: a verdict line, then findings by risk (high / medium / low), each with the evidence and the exact fix command.
4. Result summary for the owner: one verdict line (e.g. "This machine: 2 high-risk") plus the high-risk items and the report path. If anything is high risk, use needs_decision with options to fix now (as a gated follow-up) or accept; otherwise done.`,
